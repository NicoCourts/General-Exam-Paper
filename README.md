# General Exam Paper
In this paper, we explore some computations leading to the Green ring of the Schur algebra S(p,p) over a field of characteristic p, thereby determining the Balmer spectrum of D^b(S(p,p)). To do this, we explore Schur's original work on representations of GL_n and the Schur-Weyl functor relating representations of the general linear and symmetric groups.

We then shift gears and discuss more recent work of Krause et al. in developing a moinoidal structure on (a subcategory of) the category of strictly polynomial functors. This gives us a way to understand the representation theory of these algebras (via the monoidal structure) and therefore allow us to understand the Green ring.
