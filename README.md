# General Exam Paper 
*Scheduled for March 10th at 10:15am*

We begin by going through a considerable amount of domain knowledge concerning
representations of GL_n and of S_n, tracing the development from the classical
study of group representations by Schur and Weyl and the transformation of this theory in
the more robust language of affine group schemes. From there, the story takes on a more categorical flavor as we discuss different manifestations of polynomial representations of GL_n,
following the work of Friedlander and Suslin as well as Krause, Aquilino, and Reischuk. In
the latter case, we show how they determined that the Schur-Weyl functor is monoidal, opening up the theory to the machinery of monoidal categories. We take some time to develop
the theory of tensor triangulated geometry from Balmer as well as discuss some standard
constructions necessary for the theory. We end our paper by talking about how all of this
work comes together to elucidate some problems at the boundaries of modern representation
theory as well as techniques with which we can solve them.
